// Starting a chat (contracts/api.md "Tickets"): the team may open a chat with a contact the
// widget can show it to, and only when the widget proves who that is. Two kinds of contact
// qualify, not blocked either way:
//
//   - a verified identity (external_id, from the host page's user_hash or user_token): any brand's widget
//     shows it to them once the host page signs them in;
//   - an anonymous visitor, by their live session in a widget that is on, of the chat's brand,
//     whose contact holds only what came through the widget: every ticket of theirs is a chat
//     a widget started (by the visitor or by the team), and none of its messages arrived by
//     email. An address a visitor types proves nothing, so once mail from it, a call, a portal
//     request or any other ticket joins their contact, the chat reaches them only verified.
